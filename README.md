# About Me

I am currently a student studying at the University of Cincinnati. I am pursuing a BA in Information Systems while also building some fun projects on the side. 

## Current Projects:

1. www.historle.com - A daily historical event guessing game. Allows users to login and compete for leaderboard spots and track win streaks.
2. www.unifydoc.org - Allows PDF conversions. Main ability is to combine ZIP folders of multiple file types into one readable PDF.
3. www.neatsheet.org (In the works) - Will allow automated Excel sheet formatting with easy drag and drop functions. Processes can be saved as a template for future use.
