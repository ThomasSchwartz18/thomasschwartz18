# About Me

I am currently a student studying at the University of Cincinnati. I am pursuing a BA in Information Systems while also building some fun projects on the side. 

## Current Projects:

1. www.opsight.online - OpSight is a cloudbased reporting software used by PCB manufacturers to bridge communication and improving processes by centralizing operator and machine data. OpSight uses the reports filled out by operators to populate real-time dashboards and auto push reports. There is also an ability to create custom reports as well as building custom dashboards based on the KPIs and metrics that are important to the company.

## Old/ retired projects:

3. www.historle.com - A daily historical event guessing game. Allows users to login and compete for leaderboard spots and track win streaks.
4. www.unifydoc.org - Allows PDF conversions. Main ability is to combine ZIP folders of multiple file types into one readable PDF.
5. www.neatsheet.org (In the works) - Will allow automated Excel sheet formatting with easy drag and drop functions. Processes can be saved as a template for future use.
